## Question 1

Complete the function so that it will print out total cost after tax. Make sure to **call the function** afterwards.

```swift
let itemCost = 45.0
let nyTax = 0.08775

func totalWithTax() {

}
```

Then, modify the function you implemented to have a return type of `Int`, and use an external name that looks more readable. Function calls should look something like "total cost of the item after tax"

## Question 2

Convert the the following if/else statement below into function with a `String` return type.

```swift
let todaysTemperature = 72

if todaysTemperature <= 40 {
    print("It's cold out.")
} else if todaysTemperature >= 85 {
    print("It's really warm.")
} else {
    print("Weather is moderate.")
}
```


## Question 3

Write a function named `min2` that takes two `Int` values, `a` and `b`, and returns the smallest one.

Function Definition
`func min2(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int`

Example:
Input: `min2(a:1, b:2)`

Output: `1`


## Question 4

Write a function that takes an `Int` and returns its last digit. Name the function `lastDigit`. Use _ to ignore the external parameter name.

Function Definition:
`func lastDigit(_ number: Int) -> Int`

Example:
Input: `lastDigit(12345)`

Output: `5`


## Question 5

Write a function that takes in any two positive integers and return the sum.


## Question 6

Write a function takes in any number grade and returns a corresponding letter grade.

| Number Grade | Equivalent Letter Grade |
| :--------: | :---------: |
| 100 | A+ |
| 90 - 99 | A |
| 80 - 89 | B |
| 70 - 79 | C |
| 65 - 69 | D |
| Below 65 | F |


## Question 7

Make a calculator function that takes in three parameters (two numbers and one operator) and returns the answer of the operation.

Operator parameter: (+, -, x, /)


## Question 8

Write a function so that it will print out **total cost after tip.**

```swift
let mealCost = 45
let tipPercentage = 0.15

//Write your code below

let myFinalCost = totalWithTip() //Fill in the arguments
```

Write a function that will print out **total cost after tip and tax.**

```swift
let taxPercentage = 0.09

//Write your code below

let myFinalCostWithTipAndTax = totalWithTipAndTax() //Fill in the arguments in function
```


## Question 9

Implement a function named `repeatPrint` that takes a string `message` and a integer `count` as parameters. The function should print `message` `count` number of times and then print a newline.

Example:
Input: `repeatPrint(message: "+", count: 10)`

Output: `++++++++++`


## Question 10

Write a function named `first` that takes an Int named n and returns an array with the first n numbers starting from 1.

Function Definition
`func first(_ n: Int) -> [Int]`

Example:
Input: `first(3)`

Output: `[1, 2, 3]`


## Question 11

Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to x, except:

If the number if a multiple of 3, print `"Fizz"` instead of the number
If the number is a multiple of 5, print `"Buzz"` instead of the number
If the number is a multiple of 3 AND 5, print `"FizzBuzz"` instead of the number
Your function should take in one parameter: x (the number to count up to)


## Question 12

Write a function named `reverse` that takes an array of integers named `numbers` as a parameter. The function should return an array with the numbers from `numbers` in reverse order.


Example:
Input: `reverse([1, 2, 3])`

Output: `[3, 2, 1]`


## Question 13

Write a function that prints out the most frequently appearing Int in an array of Int.


## Question 14

Write a function that sums all the even indices of an array of Ints.


## Question 15

Write a function that flips a dictionary.  All of the keys are now values and all of the values are now keys.

Example:
Input: `[1: "hi", 5: "bye:]`

Output: `["hi": 1, "bye": 5]`

# Bonus 

## Question 1

Write a function that finds the person with the second highest test score in a Dictionary that maps names to scores.

Example:
Input: `["Person 1": 83, "Person 2": 74, "Person 3": 82]`

Output: `"Person 3"`

## Question 2

Write a function that determines if a value is inside of array.


## Question 3

Write a function takes an `Int` as input, and returns true if it is even, or false if it is odd.
Using your new function, write code that prints out whether `dieRoll` is even or odd:

`let dieRoll = Int(arc4random_uniform(6) + 1)`
